# Halo_Gauntlet

The Halo Gauntlet is a toy project. It was designed to be a wearable used while playing the game Halo 3. 
The device was a sort of "gauntlet" worn that involved a tens unit and an arduino. The device connected to a pc via usb and communicated with the host
program on the pc that constantly monitored the health of the player. If the health of the player dropped, the tens unit would activate, giving the player
a shock.

The project was an interesting look into python computer vision libraries as well as basic electric circuit designs to control the tens unit.
